# Data

    For the training of this model we use the ImageNet object localization challenge dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge).

    We take a random subset of length 10,000 images from this dataset, assuming that the resulting dataset is balanced. Furthermore, we split this last subset into a training and validation subset at a ratio of 9:1.
